      <p>“I want to express my extreme gratitude for the care I received at your hospital. From the moment I went in to have an echocardiogram to the time of discharge, every experience with every department was great. I have been a nurse for 35 years and I have never seen hospital staff like yours. From housekeeping to dietary, nursing, valet and all the other departments, I was impressed. I will recommend Griffin hospital to everyone going forward. Thank you for a wonderful experience despite the fact that I was hospitalized.”</p>
